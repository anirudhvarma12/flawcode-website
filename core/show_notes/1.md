## Deep Learning With Vijay:

Do you ever wonder Is this Artificial Intelligence hype real, if its real how everything works on the back end, how Jarvis helps Iron Man, who is doing this? Do you ever wonder about the life of the people who make such technologies possible and at our fingertips? Seems like those people would be living the dream isnt it? Well... here we are bringing our first guest to the show. Vijay, who is one of those people living the dream that we had been talking. He has recently started the company HEUW. He also organises the amazing dlblr meetup. We will know more about him and his work.

Theano is a Python library and optimizing compiler for manipulating and evaluating expressions, especially matrix-valued ones

[Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and by community contributors.

[Transfer Learning](https://www.quora.com/How-does-transfer-learning-work)

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique, where knowledge gain during training in one type of problem is used to train in other similar type of problem.
