Some questions and discussion highlights:

How to get into the security community? How the bug bounties pays less in India? How can developers become more security aware? How do you see the IOT boom and security? What are your thoughts on the [recent controversy about guardian and the whatsapp controversy][1]. Do you think the media doesnt understand controversy. What measures can be taken regarding this?
