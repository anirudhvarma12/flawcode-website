# Deep Learning with the JVM

<img class="img-thumbnail" src="../images/susan.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 180px;"/>

Susan Eraly is a Software Engineer at Skymind.io. She primarily works on making deep learning frameworks more easily available on the JVM. The core focus of skymind.io is to bring the deep learning and AI to the business and enterprise community and in that endeavour skymind supports the popular open source repository DL4J. Lets hear a small conversation with Eraly where she speaks on the deep learning, the work she does on DL4J, how she works and co-ordinates using open source and the advice she gives to junior developers who are just coming to the field of software engineering.
